# Copilot Instructions for scipy-stubs

## Type annotations

Use `A | B` instead of `Union[A, B]`.
Use `*Ts` instead of `Unpack[Ts]`.
Use `type[T]` and `list[T]` instead of `Type[T]` and `List[T]`.
Import `Sequence`, `Mapping`, `Iterable`, `Iterator`, `Generator`, and `Callable` from
`collections.abc` instead of `typing`.
The `typing_extensions` module is used for type annotations that are not yet available
in the standard library, which is needed for `T = TypeAlias("T", default=...)`,
`Alias = TypeAliasType("Alias", ...)`, `@deprecated`, etc.
We currently require Python 3.11 or higher.

## Environment Setup

We use UV to manage the project dependencies. To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
uv install
```

## Linting and formatting

For linting, we use `ruff`. To run the linter, execute:

```bash
uv run ruff check --fix
```

To format the code, we use `black`. To format the code, execute:

```bash
uv run ruff format
```

Be sure to format the code before committing any changes.

Lines can be 130 characters long in `*.pyi` stubs.

## Static Type Checking

Static type checking of `scipy-stubs`, and its type-tests, is performed using
`basedpyright` and `mypy`. To run these checks, execute the following commands:

```bash
uv run basedpyright
uv run --no-editable mypy .
```

If only the tests should be checked, you can run:

```bash
uv run basedpyright tests
uv run --no-editable mypy tests
```

Note that the errors reported by the vscode mypy plugin can take a long time to update.
If you think that could be the case, then feel free to ignore those errors.

## Stubtest

To run stubtest, execute the following command:

```bash
poe stubtest
```

If `poe` is not available, then you can find the full stubtest command under the
`[tool.poe.tasks.stubtest]` section in the `pyproject.toml` at the root of the project.

## Tox

If you want to run all checks in parallel and with multiple Python versions, run:

```bash
uvx tox p
```
